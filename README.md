KnowledgeQuest 🎮

KnowledgeQuest is a simple yet fun C# Windows Forms quiz application.
It allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, keeps track of correct and incorrect answers, and displays results at the end of the game.

This project is designed as a small educational app to demonstrate Windows Forms controls, event handling, and conditional logic in C#.

📖 Project Overview

KnowledgeQuest simulates a quiz game where users face a series of multiple-choice questions.
Each question has 4 possible answers, and the player must select the correct one.

The game provides:

Immediate feedback (✔️ for correct answers, ❌ for wrong ones).

A counter that tracks correct and incorrect answers.

A final result screen showing the total score.

This makes it a good beginner-friendly project for understanding event-driven programming in Windows Forms.
